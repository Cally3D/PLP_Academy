Question 1
Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
(Answer) 
The concept of version control using github as a case study involves the process of tracking changes made in our project as we work on the go. This is very important as it also fosters collaboration and security of our programming project in a cloud based platform such as git. The beautiful thing about version control systems is that these changes are initiated manually and committed into the cloud based platform. Other programmers can go through our work/project depending on the permissions granted by the owner. It also gives room for agile improvement of the code without total changes as the new updates are simply merged to existing projects. This makes our project robust as well as streamlines the processes involved in project development.

Question 2
Describe the process of setting up a new repository on GitHub. What are the key steps, and what are some of the important decisions you must make during this process?

Question 3
Discuss the importance of the README file in a GitHub repository. What should be included in a well-written README, and how does it contribute to effective collaboration?
(Answer) 
A README file is a text based file that give a detailed overview of what the project is all about. It also outlines the intention of the project and how best to utilise or optimise it. It's mostly made up of instructions on how to use the file or project. 

Question 4
Compare and contrast the differences between a public repository and a private repository on GitHub. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each, particularly in the context of collaborative projects?
(Answer) 
A public repository is an open source repository and code that is accessible to the public. This means that anyone can use the code as well as make changes to it to suit their specific need and use case while a private repository is not open source. The access to the files and code in a private repository is limited to the owner and who he grants permission to access the file, view, edit or work on it. 

Question 5
Detail the steps involved in making your first commit to a GitHub repository. What are commits, and how do they help in tracking changes and managing different versions of your project?
(Answer)

Question 6
How does branching work in Git, and why is it an important feature for collaborative development on GitHub? Discuss the process of creating, using, and merging branches in a typical workflow.

Question 7
Explore the role of pull requests in the GitHub workflow. How do they facilitate code review and collaboration, and what are the typical steps involved in creating and merging a pull request?

Question 8
Discuss the concept of "forking" a repository on GitHub. How does forking differ from cloning, and what are some scenarios where forking would be particularly useful?

Question 9
Examine the importance of issues and project boards on GitHub. How can they be used to track bugs, manage tasks, and improve project organization? Provide examples of how these tools can enhance collaborative efforts.

Question 10
Reflect on common challenges and best practices associated with using GitHub for version control. What are some common pitfalls new users might encounter, and what strategies can be employed to overcome them and ensure smooth collaboration?
